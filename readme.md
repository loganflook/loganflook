# Hi there 👋
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Logan Flook, a passionate cyber security enthusiast and professional. Currently, I work as a full-time incident responder with a background in digital forensics. I am continuously working hard to become the best DFIR practitioner I can be through both proprietary and open-source tools. I care deeply about the cyber security domain and community. 

Right now I primarily spend my time responding the threats within various EDR platforms including SentinelOne, CrowdStrike and Carbon Black, and running proprietary forensics/response tool kits.

Let's collaborate and make the world a more secure place!
